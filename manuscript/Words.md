# Words
For us words will be finite sequences of letters over an alphabet. For example
if the alphabet is `{N, E, S, W}`, we could form any of the following words

* `N`, `E`, `S`, `W`, i.e. any single occurrence of a letter in the alphabet.
* `NEWS`, a finite sequence of letters.
* ``, i.e. the empty word.
