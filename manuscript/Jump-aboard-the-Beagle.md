# Jump aboard the HMS Beagle[^beagle]
In this chapter we will give a lay-mans introduction to evolution and how it
applies to the projects we are studying.

## Evolution
Evolution tracks a *population* over time in their *environment*. A population
consists of *individuals*. Individuals differ by there *genetic makeup*.
The survival of the genetic makeup of a individuals is determined by their
*fitness*, i.e. how well they are adapted to their environment. Individuals that
are fitter, have a higher chance of reproducing, allowing their genetic makeup
to prosper.


[^beagle]: The [HMS Beagle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Beagle) was the
    ship that took
    [Charles Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin) around the
    world. It wad during this trip that Darwin collected data that led him to
    formulate the idea of evolution. His work culminated into his seminal book
    [On the Origins of Species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species).
