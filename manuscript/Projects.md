# Projects
In this chapter we describe the back story for our projects in a little detail.

## Nadezhda
This projects aims to model a simple robotic cockroach. The cockroach moves
along a line. Each turn it either takes a step forward, takes a step backwards,
or stops.

The goal of the cockroach is to reach a supply of food somewhere along the line.

## AGC
In this project we are modeling doing calculations with a single variable. One
example would be {$$}3x + 5{/$$}.

The goal is to match a series of function values as closely as possible

## Moonlander
This is the ultimate project. The goal for this project is to safely land a
lander on the surface of the moon. We are modeling the control program of the
lander. Each decision moment the program can decide to do the following things

1. *Skip*, does nothing
2. *Left*, fires some positioning blasters that will increase the rotational
   speed to the left.
3. *Right*, does something similar as Left, only to the right.
4. *Thrust*, fire the main thruster, changing the velocity of the lander.
