# What to Do
Here we give some suggestions for projects you could do

1. Tweak Fitness Function
2. AGC
3. Bring your Own

## Tweak Fitness Function
In this project you will learn the importance of a fitness function by trying to
land a lunar lander safely on the surface of the moon. Find a detailed
description in the corresponding chapter.
j
## AGC
We will try to fit the series of points with a function. You find a skeleton
project in the `AGC` directory. See the AGC chapter in the accompanying book for
a description of the book.

## Bring your own 
We would love to see this tool used to solve a problem that you have. There is a
skeleton project that will give you a running start. Other than that you are on
your own.
