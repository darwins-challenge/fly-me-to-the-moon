# Framework

## Moonlander
The moonlander grammar is fairly involved. It is responsible for expression
control logic for the lander. As such it is capable of making _decisions_ based
on _calculations_ involving _sensor readings_.

Listing the entire grammar would take up a lot of space. It is best to inspect
the grammar from the code.
