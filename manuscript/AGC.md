With the use of the framework getting started with genetic programming comes
down to the following steps

1. Describe a grammar.
2. Describe a fitness function.

The only thing you need is a good description of the problem.

## Description
We want polynomial function like {$$}3x^{2}+2x+1{/$$} that will fit values. More
specifically given {$$}n{/$$} values, e.g $3, 1, 4, 1, 5$, the target function
{$$}f{/$$} should the {$$}i{/$$}th value when evaluating {$$}i{/$$}, i.e.
{$$}f(0) = 3{/$$}, {$$}f(1) = 1{/$$} etcetera.
