# What this book is all about
This book is an compendium to a workshop exploring
[genetic programming][genetic-programming]. Genetic programming is

> a technique whereby computer programs are encoded as a set of genes that are
> then modified (evolved) using an evolutionary algorithm.

This book will explain various ideas and will ground them by discussing ways you
could implement them. It will provide you with a practical introduction to
genetic programming and hones it with exercises, both pen and paper as
implementation exercises.
